When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    It will be useful when we want to save a backup for our repository that is
    not at risk of losing it if something happens to our computer. It is also
    making it possible to share it with any number of people we want and at
    their convenient time instead of being restricted by th number of people we
    can share it or be able to coordinate with them.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because we want to keep a valid copy of working maser commit in our repository and prevent it from unwanted changes without any checks or verification.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branch is to create a copy of a commit within a repository in which we can make changes without changing the contents of the master commit. Fork is producing a copy of a repository within GitHub. Clone is copying the repository between any different locations including GitHub or local machine.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It will help organizing and synchronizing the local and remote depositories.
    It also helps to keep track of the changes made through a collaboration.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    sending the changing by email or other communications tool and wait for verification and if everything was fixed through several back and forth correction, we can make the final changes.
    Using Git and GitHub make it much easier.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
